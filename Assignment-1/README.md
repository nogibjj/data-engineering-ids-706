This assignment is to get exposure to PySpark through performing some EDA and deriving insights from a "Big Data" dataset. The dataset used here is the Zillow Home Value Index (all housing types at a state level). 

In addition, this assignment will also contain the setup to optimize the setup for code spaces. This will also be used in forthcoming assignments.
