This assignment is to get exposure to PySpark through performing some EDA and deriving insights from a "Big Data" dataset. The dataset used here is the Zillow Home Value Index (all housing types at a state level). 

In addition, this assignment will also contain the setup to optimize the setup for code spaces. This will also be used in forthcoming assignments. 

The goal of this analysis to identify states that have mostly likely had a housing bubble. Across the country, house prices fell post the various interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. By identifying states where the prices fell the most, we can identify the states that were most likely to have had a housing bubble. 

From the analysis, we can see that the following three states have had the largest drop in house values post the hikes.
