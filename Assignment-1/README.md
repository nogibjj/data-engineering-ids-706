This assignment is to get exposure to PySpark through performing some EDA and deriving insights from a "Big Data" dataset. In this case the dataset is the OpenAQ dataset. This a public dataset that is hosted and maintained by AWS. The goal of this assignment is to explore the effects of Covid-19 on air pollution. 

In addition, this assignment will also contain the setup to optimize the setup for code spaces. This will also be used in forthcoming assignments.
